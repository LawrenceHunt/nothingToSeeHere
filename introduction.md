# Project Week

### What is Project Week?
Project Week is one of the most important weeks at Makers Academy. It marks your transition from the first half of the course - where foundational concepts and technologies are introduced - to the second half of the course, where these are applied in increasingly more project-based scenarios. Since working in teams is a huge part of being a professional developer, Project week will also introduce group work.

In addition to this, we will introduce a completely new way of working on software projects, which gives a much closer experience to interpreting a real-world brief using industry-standard processes to plan and execute the tasks at hand.

### What will I be doing during Project Week?

You will be working on a project where you will learn how to:

* Extract User Stories from the specification as a team **(Workshop: Monday morning)**
* Convert User Stories to Tickets on a Card Wall using Github and Waffle **(Part of above workshop)**
* Interpret the kind of specification you’d get from a well-organised design team/marketing agency/entrepreneur
* Take clearly laid out mockups for a user interface and recreate them in the browser

### Who will I be working with?

Each team will consist of approximately 4 people. The teams will be selected by the coaches (and randomised)

### How should I approach Project Week?
We believe that it's extremely important for onsite students to work from our space here at MA for the week, so from a logistical perspective, we would expect:

* That onsite students be at Makers Academy from **9:30am, Monday through Friday**. Ronin students to be present and available on slack for the same times.
* That you work in a team, pair with members of your team, and run daily stand-ups within that team.
* Coordinate on Slack (e.g. in private groups)

### What are the delivery expectations?

We are asking you to deliver the project in MVP steps. ​**You are unlikely to finish the whole project.** Just like in a regular team, you will be asked for a car and should deliver a working bicycle, not just a pair of wheels. You will practice being **‘always finished’.**

### What is the aim of this week?

* You are going to use the technologies, skills and techniques you have been practicing. That is: Sinatra, Databases, Authentication, great Ruby, connecting to APIs, and a little JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You should rotate within your groups to ensure you get to focus on the techs you want practice at most. ​_Avoid doing whatever is easiest: do what you find hard._​ So, one reason is ‘so you can consolidate and practice stuff you’ve been working on in the past 5 weeks’.
* You know how to do TDD in controlled circumstances, but this tends to fall apart in a project setting. You need to experience why this happens, the pressures that conflict with good software practices, and how to retrospect on them so when you reach the later Project Weeks (9, and 10 & 11) you know how to handle these things.
* You’re picking up ‘battle scars’. The main thing our Hiring Partners tell us they want is more experience doing things in a project setting. This is your first real opportunity to do so.

### What support can I expect during Project Week?

* Coaches spend Week 6 intensively focussed on curriculum development, conducting their own retrospectives and planning activities related to developing the course and related materials. As a result, there is no coach support for standup or retrospectives beyond the first day.

### What happens next?
* We will release the challenge specification and teams on Monday morning after the workshop.
* On the following Monday after Project Week (Monday W7) we will meet to review the Weekend Challenge (yes, there is a W5/6 weekend challenge too!). Then, from 12.30 - 1.30 we will present our projects.
* There is no ‘points system’, but it will be judged like a hackathon project, on the following criteria:
    * Code quality
    * Test coverage
    * Feature delivery
    * MVP design

## Manipulating Table Data

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

We have created a Postgres database, and added one table to it. At the moment, there's no data in the table. However, we have added a data structure, ready to be filled with custom data.

In this challenge, you will use SQL to add, delete, update, and **query** data in the table you created, inside your Postgres database.

## Learning Objectives covered

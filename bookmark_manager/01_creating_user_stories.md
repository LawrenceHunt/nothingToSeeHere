## Creating User stories

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

The website will have the following specification:

* It shows a list of links from the database
* New links can be added
* Links can be tagged
* Links can be filtered by a tag

First up we will create user stories for each of these in the Stakeholder/Motivation/Action format, e.g.

```
As a Makers Student
So that I can be on time for standups
I want to purchase a new alarm clock
```

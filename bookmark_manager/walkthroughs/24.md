# Walkthrough

### Signing out

So far we learned how to create the users and sign them in. Let's see how we can log them out.

Since "signed in" only means that there's a user_id in the session, logging the user out is as simple as setting the session[:user_id] to nil. Let's write a test.

```ruby
feature 'User signs out' do

  before(:each) do
    User.create(email: 'test@test.com',
                password: 'test',
                password_confirmation: 'test')
  end

  scenario 'while being signed in' do
    sign_in(email: 'test@test.com', password: 'test')
    click_button 'Sign out'
    expect(page).to have_content('goodbye!')
    expect(page).not_to have_content('Welcome, test@test.com')
  end

end
```

Since the sign_in helper is now used for more than one feature (sign in and sign out).

Extract #sign_in & #sign_up methods out of your feature files and into a separate helper module, then include it as a module within your spec_helper, like so:

```ruby
#spec/helpers/session.rb

module SessionHelpers

 def sign_in(email:, password:)
   visit '/sessions/new'
   fill_in :email, with: email
   fill_in :password, with: password
   click_button 'Sign in'
 end

 def sign_up(email: 'alice@example.com',
             password: '12345678',
             password_confirmation: '12345678')
   visit '/users/new'
   fill_in :email, with: email
   fill_in :password, with: password
   fill_in :password_confirmation, with: password_confirmation
   click_button 'Sign up'
 end

end
```

```ruby
#spec/spec_helper.rb

require_relative 'helpers/session'

RSpec.configure do |config|

  config.include SessionHelpers

end
```

We will now need to display the Sign Out button that the test expects. The layout is a good place to do it since we'll need it on all pages of our site.

```html
  <% if current_user %>
    Welcome, <%= current_user.email %>
    <form method='post' action='/sessions'>
      <input type='hidden' name='_method' value='delete'>
      <input type='submit' value='Sign out'>
    </form>
  <% end %>
```

The form sends a POST request to /sessions but it also includes a hidden field `_method` (note the underscore) with value "delete". The reason is that the common convention for a url that destroys a resource is sending a DELETE request to /resource_url. However, modern browsers are unable to send any requests other than GET or POST when the form is being submitted. To solve this problem, you can include a hidden field called `_method` that will override the actual type of request. When Sinatra receives this request, it will behave as if it were a DELETE request and not a POST request. Therefore, the handler for this form needs to specify "delete" as an HTTP verb:

You need to add this line to the Sinatra server

```ruby
class BookmarkManager
  use Rack::MethodOverride
```

This will allow us to use a new method in our server file, 'delete'. The final piece to this puzzle is that we need a Sinatra 'delete' method to handle the incoming signout request.  It will need to set a flash message, invalidate the session for the user who is signing out and then redirect appropriately. It looks like this:

```
delete '/sessions' do
  session[:user_id] = nil
  flash.keep[:notice] = 'goodbye!'
  redirect to '/links'
end
```

Note the use of `flash.keep` to persist the flash notice over the redirect.

Unless you don't have it already you'll also need flash[:notice] in the layout.

```html
  <% if flash[:notice] %>
    <div id='notice'>
      <%= flash[:notice] %>
    </div>
  <% end %>
```

The tests should now pass, so we know that the user can now be signed out.  As usual check manually that everything works and do the same on heroku.

# Walkthrough

[Back to Challenge](../23_signing_in.md)

The users can sign up on our website but there's no way to sign in if you happen to be logged out (not that we have logging out functionality yet but we'll do that next challenge). Here's a test for signing in.

```ruby
feature 'User sign in' do

  let!(:user) do
    User.create(email: 'user@example.com',
                password: 'secret1234',
                password_confirmation: 'secret1234')
  end

  scenario 'with correct credentials' do
    sign_in(email: user.email,   password: user.password)
    expect(page).to have_content "Welcome, #{user.email}"
  end

  def sign_in(email:, password:)
    visit '/sessions/new'
    fill_in :email, with: email
    fill_in :password, with: password
    click_button 'Sign in'
  end

end
```

This should fail like so:

```
User sign in with correct credentials
    Failure/Error: fill_in :email, with: email
    Capybara::ElementNotFound:
      Unable to find field :email
```

The only interesting part in this test is "visit '/sessions/new'" in the 'sign_in' method.  Why do we want to sign_in at "/sessions/new", and not at "/sign_in", "/users/sign_in", "/login" or something like this? Technically, it would work but it wouldn't be as elegant.

When signing in or out, we are manipulating a session: creating it, destroying it, and displaying a form to create it. By creating urls that define actions that apply to resources, we will achieve more elegant and easy to understand urls. Compare this

```
/users/new
/users
/users/edit
/sessions/new
/sessions
```

to this

```
/create_user_form
/create_user
/edit_user_form
/edit_user
/sign_in_form
/sign_in
/logout
```

The first approach is far more elegant. We've barely touched how urls should be defined (it's a slightly larger topic) but we'll go into details in Routing and REST.

You should now have a test driving you to create your path and form. To make this pass, we'll need a form in `views/sessions/new.erb`:

A route to show a form:

```ruby
get '/sessions/new' do
  erb :'sessions/new'
end
```

The form itself:

```html
<h1>Please sign in</h1>

<form action='/sessions' method='post'>
  <label for='email'>
    Email: <input name='email' type='email'>
  </label>
  <label for='password'>
    Password: <input name='password' type='password'>
  </label>
  <input type='submit' value='Sign in'>
</form>
```

The error we get now is superficially similar to the error that we had previously ("Sinatra doesn't know this ditty"), however there is a difference. We will need to create a route to handle this incoming post request:

```ruby
post '/sessions' do
  user = User.authenticate(params[:email], params[:password])
  if user
    session[:user_id] = user.id
    redirect to('/links')
  else
    flash.now[:errors] = ['The email or password is incorrect']
    erb :'sessions/new'
  end
end
```

and the User.authenticate method that we'll get to in a second.

**Note that we're using the same pattern we used before:** we try to obtain the user object by authenticating using the email and password provided and then check if we got one. If we did, we sign the user in and redirect. If we didn't, we show an error and display the form again.

Finally, we need a class method to authenticate a user. At this stage we have a failing feature test, but the only way to reach a solution is to write a ruby method on our User class.

```ruby
# in /spec/models/user_spec.rb
describe User do

  let!(:user) do
    User.create(email: 'test@test.com', password: 'secret1234',
               password_confirmation: 'secret1234')
  end

  it 'authenticates when given a valid email address and password' do
    authenticated_user = User.authenticate(user.email, user.password)
    expect(authenticated_user).to eq user
  end

end

```

This then drives us to minimally implement the authenticate method below:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
def self.authenticate(email, password)
  first(email: email)
end

```

Now let's write the test for a failing authentication:
```ruby
it 'does not authenticate when given an incorrect password' do
  expect(User.authenticate(user.email, 'wrong_stupid_password')).to be_nil
end
```
So now we should actually create our logic:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

def self.authenticate(email, password)
  # that's the user who is trying to sign in
  user = first(email: email)
  # if this user exists and the password provided matches
  # the one we have password_digest for, everything's fine
  #
  # The Password.new returns an object that has a different implementation of the equality(`==`)
  # method. Instead of comparing two passwords directly
  # (which is impossible because we only have a one-way hash)
  # the == method calculates the candidate password_digest from
  # the password given and compares it to the password_digest
  # it was initialised with.
  # So, to recap: THIS IS NOT A STRING COMPARISON
  if user && BCrypt::Password.new(user.password_digest) == password
    # return this user
    user
  else
    nil
  end
end
```

Since we're using BCrypt to generate a one-way hash, we cannot compare the passwords directly. We genuinely have no way of recovering the actual password. It is lost forever. However, what we do have is a digest that we can use to check if the password the user is trying to log in with is correct.

So we pass the password that the user is trying to log in with to the `==` method of the BCrypt::Password class. That method then calculates the digest for that password and compares it to the one in the database.

The tests now pass and you should manually check the functionality locally and on Heroku.

# Walkthrough

[Back to Challenge](../08_viewing_links.md)

Let's set up the project:

* As you'd do with every new project, create a new repository on Github.  
* Name your project 'bookmark_manager'.
* From your project directory, run `bundle init` to generate a Gemfile.
* In the Gemfile:
  - specify the version of Ruby that you wish to use.
  - make a test group and add `gem 'rspec'` and `gem 'capybara'`
* Run `bundle`.
* Add `require 'capybara/rspec'` to your spec_helper.rb (use `rspec --init` if you're not comfortable creating your own spec_helper).

Now, let's write a feature test for the following user story:

```
As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly go to web sites I regularly visit
I would like to see a list of links on the homepage
```

Create a feature test like the following in `spec/viewing_links_spec.rb`:

```ruby
feature 'Viewing links' do

  scenario 'I can see existing links on the links page' do
    # We can use `.create`, which we used in irb to make a Student, within our test!
    Link.create(url: 'http://www.makersacademy.com', title: 'Makers Academy')

    visit '/links'

    # this is a *temporary* sanity check - to make sure we
    # can load the page :)
    expect(page.status_code).to eq 200

    within 'ul#links' do
      expect(page).to have_content('Makers Academy')
    end
  end
end
```

> Why do we use a `within` block to test for the presence of the link? What might happen if we _didn't_ use the `within` block?

When you run this test, you will encounter a familiar error "uninitialized constant Link". At this stage we are being driven to create a class called `Link`.

> From here on out, we're going to use the term 'model' for the classes we create that model a domain within a web application. Together, a bunch of 'models' constitute the 'model layer'.

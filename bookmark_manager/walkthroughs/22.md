# Preventing duplicate registrations

Let's write a test first, checking that we can't register the same user twice.

```ruby
scenario 'I cannot sign up with an existing email' do
  sign_up
  expect { sign_up }.to_not change(User, :count)
  expect(page).to have_content('Email is already taken')
end
```

You will receive the following error:

```
1) User sign up I cannot sign up with an existing email
    Failure/Error: expect(page).to have_content('Email is already taken')
      expected to find text "Email is already taken" in "Welcome, alice@example.com Password and confirmation password do not match Please sign up Email: Password: Password Confirmation:"
```

We need to introduce a unique constraint on our `email` field.

```ruby
property :email, String, required: true, unique: true
```

Now let's improve our controller code. Right now it looks like this.

```ruby
if @user.save
  session[:user_id] = user.id
  redirect to('/links')
else
  flash.now[:notice] = "Password and confirmation password do not match"
  erb :'users/new'
end
```
The problem is that the only error message that this controller can show is the one about passwords not being the same. However, we need to show various error messages and even several messages at the same time if necessary. 

Fortunately, DataMapper models include an `errors` method which returns an object with methods like `full_messages` that tell us what went wrong.  `full messages` returns an array of error messages.

```ruby
if @user.save
  session[:user_id] = @user.id
  redirect to('/')
else
  flash.now[:errors] = @user.errors.full_messages
  erb :'users/new'
end
```

Note that we're switching from using flash `:notice` to flash `:errors`. Given that these errors prevent us from proceeding further, it's more appropriate to call them errors.

The `@user.errors` object can also be used to get errors for a given field, and with some clever erb, you can display error messages next to the relevant field in the html.  However, for now, let's just display a list in the flash:

```html
<% if flash[:errors] && !flash[:errors].empty? %>
  Please refer to the following errors below:
  <ul id='errors'>
    <% flash[:errors].each do |error| %>
      <li><%= error %></li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
<% end %>
```

Note that we'll have to update our password mismatch test since the generated message is slightly different from our earlier custom one.

Now we get a list of errors if the user is trying to both register with the same email and mistypes the password.

Your previous test for the validation of email presence should now look like this:

```ruby
  scenario 'I cannot sign up without an email address' do
    expect { sign_up(email: nil) }.not_to change(User, :count)
    expect(current_path).to eq('/users')
    expect(page).to have_content('Email must not be blank')
  end
```

Do the same for the email format test:

```ruby
  scenario 'I cannot sign up with an invalid email address' do
    expect { sign_up(email: "invalid@email") }.not_to change(User, :count)
    expect(current_path).to eq('/users')
    expect(page).to have_content('Email has an invalid format')
  end
```

It should also pass as a consequence of the previous changes.

We have all the code we need to make our tests pass. (If your tests fail, the chances are the database is in an inconsistent state, see the next section).

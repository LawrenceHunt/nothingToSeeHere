# Walkthrough

[Back to Challenge](../14_deploying_to_heroku.md)

Assuming you have [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed you should do the following to create your Heroku app (you must choose a unique app name):

```sh
$ heroku create bookmark-manager-example
```

Check that you see "Welcome to your new app!" at https://bookmark-manager-example.herokuapp.com/ or whatever your app is called.

Check that running `heroku create` has set up the appropriate git remote and that all your changes are checked into git:

```sh
$ git remote -v
heroku	https://git.heroku.com/bookmark-manager-example.git (fetch)
heroku	https://git.heroku.com/bookmark-manager-example.git (push)
origin	git@github.com:tansaku/bookmark_manager_dm_test.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:tansaku/bookmark_manager_dm_test.git (push)

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```


Note: please ensure that all necessary gems are in your Gemfile and that you are updated to the latest version of bundler:

```ruby
# Gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'sinatra'
gem 'data_mapper'
gem 'dm-postgres-adapter'
gem 'database_cleaner'

group :test do
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'rspec'
end
```

```sh
$ gem update bundler
```

Now push your code to heroku using the following command:

```sh
$ git push heroku [your-branch-name]:master
```
> If you are pushing from your local `master` branch, then you can simplify the above command to just `git push heroku master`.

and you should see something like the following:

```
Counting objects: 63, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (55/55), done.
Writing objects: 100% (63/63), 8.02 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 63 (delta 24), reused 0 (delta 0)

...

remote: Verifying deploy... done.
To https://git.heroku.com/bookmark-manager-example.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

https://bookmark-manager-example.herokuapp.com/ will now show an application error.  How can we find out what is wrong?  The critical step is to run `heroku logs`:

```sh
2015-10-06T08:59:48.323227+00:00 app[web.1]: 	Is the server running on host "localhost" (127.0.0.1) and accepting
2015-10-06T08:59:48.323199+00:00 app[web.1]: /app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.0.0/gems/data_objects-0.10.16/lib/data_objects/connection.rb:79:in `initialize': could not connect to server: Connection refused (DataObjects::ConnectionError)
2015-10-06T08:59:48.323229+00:00 app[web.1]: 	TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
```

As described [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rack#using-datamapper-or-sequel) you need to update your datamapper db configuration:

```ruby
DataMapper.setup(:default, ENV['DATABASE_URL'] || "postgres://localhost/bookmark_manager_#{ENV['RACK_ENV']}")
```

And as described [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#provisioning-the-add-on) you must add the postgresql addon to your heroku app:

```sh
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```

Then https://bookmark-manager-example.herokuapp.com/links (or whatever your heroku app is called) should show the same functionality as you have locally.

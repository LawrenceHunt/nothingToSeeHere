[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

You've now created a database and manipulated data within it, entirely from within Ruby: thanks to the power of an ORM.

In this challenge, you will learn the basic building blocks of how to interact with data inside a database: **Create, Read, Update, Delete** (**CRUD**).

## Password Confirmation

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

Now a user can register on our website but it would be nice to ask for password confirmation on registration to make sure there's no mistake in the password.

In this challenge you will create password confirmation functionality.

## Learning Objectives covered

* Configure password verification with a password_confirmation field
* Use validation within models

## To complete this challenge, you will need to

- [ ] Write a failing feature test that checks that when a user signs up with a mismatching password confirmation that no new users are created
- [ ] As usual this test should fail, make it pass with the appropriate changes to your
models, views and controllers.
- [ ] Use `validates_confirmation_of` to validate the passwords match
- [ ] Deploy to heroku and perform manual test for this functionality

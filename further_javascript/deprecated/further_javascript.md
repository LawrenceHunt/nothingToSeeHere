#Week 8 - Further JavaScript

***Please note, as with all Makers Academy materials, there may be subtle errors in the following materials.  Please try to approach those as challenges on which to polish your debugging skills - pull requests always welcome.***

*Many thanks to [Alex Peattie](https://github.com/alexpeattie) and [Tansaku](https://github.com/tansaku) for the original design of the Ajax material and [Antony Denyer](https://github.com/antonydenyer) for the Angular material*

Congratulations on reaching Week 8 and attaining senior cohort status! From this point on, you will notice that there is far less 'scaffolding' in the walkthroughs. It is assumed that on reaching this stage in the course you are more familiar with technical language, reading documentation and utilising resources such as [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), your byte group and your pair. Whilst we will still structure your learning with learning objectives, resources and challenges, we encourage you to go 'off the beaten track'. Feel free to explore interesting frameworks and side projects - as long as you are working in a pair, writing tests and writing clean code, (pretty much) anything goes!

Here are this week's [learning objectives](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/further_javascript/learning_objectives.md).

##Github Profiles

This week's project is to create a simple GitHub Profile app purely in JavaScript that grabs data from the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) in order to display a specified user's avatar, number of followers and number of repos.

The project will involve using JavaScript to consume data available from third parties over the network (e.g. GitHub API data accessed via Ajax) and using more advanced JavaScript Model View Controller (MVC) frameworks such as AngularJS.

The project will need to be deployed to Heroku, and the choice of back-end server is up to you: Node for the brave, Ruby for the stable.

Here's a wireframe of one possible design:

**Experimentation is encouraged - the guides below are a suggestion, not an absolute. How you achieve the final goal is up to you.**

###Preamble

Make sure you have read through these pills before starting - they will give you a little bit more background. Don't feel that you have to work through them completely, but make sure you're familiar with the concepts:

* :pill: [npm](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/npm.md)
* :pill: [bower](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/bower.md)
* :pill: [grunt](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/grunt.md)
* :pill: [angularjs](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/angularjs.md)

For an in-depth look at the JavaScript ecosystem:
* :pill: [The JavaScript ecosystem](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/javascript_ecosystem.md)

##Version 0 - jQuery prototype & warm up

Let's have a look at a quick prototype of what we will be trying to build, and discuss why we might want to use a framework to achieve the same goals:

* [jQuery prototype](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/further_javascript/jQuery.md)

##Version 1 - Intro to Angular

* [Github profiles with Angular walkthrough](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/further_javascript/angularjs.md)  

##Version 2 - More info

Try to get your version looking more like the mockup. Get some styling in there! Test ALL THE THINGS with Protractor! (you problably skipped past the bit where it said to use Protractor, so [here's the link again](/further_javascript/protractor.md))

##Version 3 - Deploying to Heroku

Now we have a working, usable application, lets deploy to Heroku so that it can actually be used. In order to do this, you will need to build a simple server - Sinatra, for example.

If you are deploying with Sinatra, you may want to read this:

* [Deploying your Sinatra/Angular application to Heroku](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/deploying_angular_sinatra.md)



##Version 4 - Bonus Level

Keep extending the profile - can you list all of a user's repos? How about the commit count per repo? Language distribution? How can you use Angular to display this information?

What about build tools? Have you got everything optimized with Grunt? Have you thought about concatenating all the files and then minifying them? What does that even mean?!

##Version 5 - You're a masochist

Redo everything in Coffeescript (or DogeScript). But in all seriousness, actually try to redo everything in ES6.

<sup><sub>And, if you have finished all of the above (except Version 5) and you really really want to try Node (at your own peril!), have a look at these resources: [node](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/node.md), [Node guide](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/node_guide.md)</sub></sup>

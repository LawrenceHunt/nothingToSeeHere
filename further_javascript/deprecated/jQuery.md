# jQuery prototype

This is a quick and simple prototype you can use to explore some of the concepts we will be looking at this week. You can build the prototype as suggested here, and use the questions below to better understand what's going on within it.

Set up a new folder and create the following structure:

```
├── gitprofile.html
└── js
    ├── gitprofile.js
```

Add the following to `gitprofile.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
  </head>

  <body>
    <form class="gitprofile">
      <input class="username" placeholder="Enter GitHub username">
      <button type="submit">Load</button>
    </form>

    <main class="container">
    </main>

    <template>
      <article class="profile">
        <section class="pic">
        <img src={{avatar_url}}>
        </section>

        <section class="stats">
        <a href={{html_url}}>{{login}}</a>

        Repos: {{public_repos}}
        Followers: {{followers}}

        </section>
      </article>
    </template>

  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mustache.js/0.8.1/mustache.min.js"></script>
  <script src="js/gitprofile.js"></script>

  </body>
</html>
```

And the following to `gitprofile.js`:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {

  $('.gitprofile').on('submit', function(e) {

    e.preventDefault();

    var access_token = '<access_token>' // Replace this with a Github access token that you can generate as explained here https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/
    var url = 'https://api.github.com/users/' + $('input.username').val() + "?access_token=" + access_token;

    var template = $('template').html();

    $.get(url, function(info) {
      $('.container').prepend(Mustache.render(template, info));
    }).fail(function() {
      $('.container').prepend("User not found")
    }).always(function() {
      $('input.username').val('');
      });
  });
});
```

Make sure everything runs as expected.

##Discuss with your pair (and your byte)

* Make sure you understand what each and every line of code is doing.
* Have a look at the `info` that is coming back from the `$.get` request. What information does this contain?
* Do you understand why we have to pass `info` into `function(info) { .... }`? What construct in Ruby does this resemble?
* Try using `cURL` to obtain the same data in the command line.
* What is a Mustache?
* What is a template?
* How does the template interact with the data that we receive from the API call?
* What is the point of the `.fail` and `.always` methods? What happens if you take them away?
* Could we refactor the anonymous functions that are passed as arguments to `fail` and `always` into separate, more clearly named functions?
* How could we test this?
* The external libraries used here are being loaded over a CDN. What is a CDN?
* Can you adapt this to another API? What would you have to change to make it work?
* How could we have the search results return automatically as you type into the search box?
* How would you test this? Would you implement this in a different way?

## Most importantly
* Feel free to poke, prod, tear apart, and rebuild this little example as much as you want.
* This may feel deceptively simple, but it actually contains a lot of the key concepts you will be looking at in the front-end this week.

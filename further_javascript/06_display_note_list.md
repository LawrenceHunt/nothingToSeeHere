# Spike and then TDD code that shows a note in the `index.html` page

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_track.md)

In this challenge, you'll write and test code that shows a note in your `index.html` page.

You'll need to instantiate your note list model. You'll need to add a note to it. You'll need to use your note list view to convert your note list model to HTML.  You'll need to dynamically insert that HTML into the body of your `index.html` page.

Because you'll need to integrate several different elements to make the code work, try spiking the code, then deleting it and rewriting it test-first.

### Learning objectives covered

- Insert content into the DOM.
- Integrate model, view and controller code.

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Spike code that fulfils the specification below.
- [ ] Check that you can visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and see `Favourite drink: seltzer`.
- [ ] Delete your code and rewrite it using a TDD approach.

### Specification

- Code is in a file called `note-controller.js`.
- Code is wrapped in the module pattern.
- Uses the constructor and prototype pattern to define a note controller that can be instantiated.
- Takes a note list model upon instantiation. Adds a note that says `Favourite drink: seltzer`.  (You could create another file, `index.js`, to instantiate the `NoteController`.)
- Creates a note list view, passing in the note list model.
- Has a method that gets HTML from the note list view and inserts it into the `app` element.

### Tests to write

- A note controller can be instantiated.
- The `innerHTML` property of the `app` element contains HTML somewhat similar to: `<ul><li><div>Favourite food: pesto</div></li></ul>`.  (You'll need to mock some stuff to achieve this.)

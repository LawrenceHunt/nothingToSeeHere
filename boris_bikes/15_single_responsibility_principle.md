# The Single Responsibility Principle

[Back to the Challenge Map](0_challenge_map.md)

Our program is working, but it's getting complex. We need to **refactor** it into a better shape. We will do so using the first of several design principles: the **Single Responsibility Principle** ('SRP').

Consider the following lines of the `dock` method:

```
fail 'Docking station full' if @bikes.count >= 20
@bikes << bike
```

This method is doing two things:

1. Defining the capacity of the docking station (20), and
2. Docking a bike.

As it stands, `dock` _does not have a Single Responsibility_.

In this challenge, you will use **private methods** to extract method responsibilities to other methods.

> You do not need to test `private` methods.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Use the Single Responsibility Principle
- Refactor code for readability

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Define a `full?` **predicate** method that uses some of the `dock` code to return `true` or `false` depending on whether the station is full or not
- [ ] Rewrite the guard condition of your `dock` method to incorporate your new `full?` method
- [ ] Do the same for `release_bike`, using an `empty?` method
- [ ] Use the `private` keyword to ensure these methods cannot be called from 'outside' instances of the `DockingStation` class.

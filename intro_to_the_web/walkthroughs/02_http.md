# Walkthrough - The Hypertext Transfer Protocol

[Back to the Challenge](../02_http.md)

The following command makes a request to 'http://makersipsum.herokuapp.com/' with "verbose" mode enabled:

```sh
http -v http://makersipsum.herokuapp.com/
```

Let's divide the response into three sections:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Host: makersipsum.herokuapp.com
User-Agent: HTTPie/0.9.2
```
Above is the *request*. It contains request headers and other information. This originates from the *client*, "HTTPie/0.9.2", we sent it!

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 681
Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
Date: Fri, 25 Sep 2015 11:21:44 GMT
Server: WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/2.0.0/2015-04-13)
Via: 1.1 vegur
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
```
Above are the *response* headers. They originate from the server. We can see *metadata* such as what language the server is running on.

```

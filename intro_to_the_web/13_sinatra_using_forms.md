# Sinatra: Using forms

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

Our web application now serves an **interactive** page. That is: a webpage that does not always look the same, and changes based on user-supplied information.

However, it's a pain to interact with our app via the URL bar. Let's allow our users to interact with our app via a `<form>` element.

In this challenge, you will add a **form** to your view and observe how modifying its attributes alters:

- the query string it generates, and 
- the `params` your server receives.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Use a `form` element to construct a query string
- Explain the relationship between `name`, `value`, query strings, and `params`

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Add a `form` to the view rendered by the `/named-cat` route
- [ ] Set the form `action` attribute to the `/named-cat` path
- [ ] Add an `input` element within the form, with a `type` attribute of `text` and a `name` attribute of `name`
- [ ] Add another `input` element within the form, with a `type` attribute of `submit` and a `value` attribute of `Submit`
- [ ] Visit the page in your browser. Use the form to change the name of the cat
- [ ] Using `<% if %>` within your view, conditionally render the form only if a user has not entered a name (i.e. if `@name` is empty)
- [ ] Explain to your pair partner how the attributes of inputs in the form affect the query string in the URL bar when you submit the form
- [ ] Modify some of the attributes of the inputs (e.g. the `name` attribute) and explain to your pair partner how this affects the query string in the URL bar when you submit the form
- [ ] Print the incoming `params` to the server logs each time you visit the route
- [ ] Explain to your pair partner how modifying input attributes (e.g. `name`) affects the incoming `params` hash

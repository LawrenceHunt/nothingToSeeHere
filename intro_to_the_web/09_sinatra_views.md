# Sinatra: Views

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

Our web application now responds to client requests across a range of paths. For some of them, our web application returns complex cat-based HTML. Miaow.

However, things are starting to get messy. Web pages usually have hundreds - or thousands - of lines of HTML. It's inefficient to store them all in the same place as we define our routes.

In this challenge, you will use **views** to separate the Ruby and HTML code. This is the first of several steps you will take when developing a web application to encourage a clean **separation of concerns**. 

> In our case, `app.rb` will be for _routing_ (or _controlling_) concerns, and we will use another file for our _presentation_ (or _view_) concerns.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Explain the phrase 'Separation of Concerns'
- Use Views to separate routing and presentation concerns

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Create a directory called `views`, within the same directory as your `app.rb` file
- [ ] Create an `index.erb` file (a 'view file') within the `views` directory
- [ ] Move the HTML string you wrote in `app.rb` ('routing file') into the view file you just created
- [ ] Replace the HTML string in the routing file with the statement `erb(:index)`
- [ ] Restart your server, and visit your previously-working route
- [ ] Explain to your pair partner what you see.

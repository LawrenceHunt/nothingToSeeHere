# HTTP: Parameters

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

So far we've seen that HTTP requests and responses are the signals pinging between servers and clients. Every HTTP-based interaction involves a server-client relationship. In the previous challenge, we used httpie client to retrieve some data. Often, however, when we make a request of a server, we want to *tell* the server something with that request.

Within HTTP, we call data sent from a client to a server a **parameter**. Just like Ruby's hashes, parameters come as key-value pairs and a request can contain multiple parameters. One way of sending a parameter to a server is to pass it in the *query string*. The query string is a string that can be appended to an URL. It has a special set of formatting conventions.


### Learning Objectives covered
- Recognise the query string in a URL.
- Learn that query string parameters are key-value pairs sent with http requests.
- Learn the structure of the query string
- Learn how to send parameters in the query string

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Consider this url: `http://www.example.com/home?name=Bob&age=21`. Identify the following:
  - the query string
  - the number of parameters in the query string
  - the keys.
  - the values.
  - the conventions used to format query strings.
- [ ] Visit 'http://makersipsum.herokuapp.com/' in the browser. Pass your name as a parameter, using "name" as the key. The page should greet you.
- [ ] Revisit 'http://makersipsum.herokuapp.com/' without passing a parameter. Explain to your pair what the difference in behaviour tells you about the way the server treats the data passed as a parameter.

# POST/`redirect`/GET pattern

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

We've passed our first User Story, and users can enter their names. Before we move on, we should refactor our code to avoid rendering a view directly from a POST route.

In this challenge, you will use a POST-redirect loop to avoid rendering a view directly from a POST request. You will also use the `session` to store the user-submitted names between requests.

### Challenge Setup

Some of our routing logic looks like this:

```ruby
# in app.rb

post '/names' do
  @player_1 = params[:player_1_name]
  @player_2 = params[:player_2_name]
  erb :play
end
```

First, we are extracting parameters to state. Then, we are rendering a view. But a POST request is not intended for both of these purposes. We should use a GET request to render our view.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Use a POST-redirect loop
- Use the `session` to store information on a server across requests
- Access information in the `session` from within a route

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Use `enable` to enable the `session` in Sinatra
- [ ] In the `post '/names'` route, store the player names in the `session`
- [ ] Write a `get '/play` route that renders the `play.erb` view you already wrote
- [ ] In the `get '/play'` route, extract the instance variables required by the view from the `session`
- [ ] Remove the `erb :play` expression from the `post '/names'` route, and replace it with a `redirect` to the `'/play'` route
- [ ] Ensure your `enter_names_spec` feature test still passes.

#Welcome to Practice Project Week!

This week is a chance for you to practice for final projects by building a unique project.

Production code is generally built by a team of developers. It is important that you leave Makers with the skills needed to work in a team, and this is the primary reason that project weeks exist in the curriculum. This also provides a safe environment for you to be creative and enjoy exploring new directions with your code.

This is not a test, nor a challenge to see how many features you can cram into a few days. Far more important is that you have 1 feature that is fully tested end-to-end, and that you have worked well together as a team using Agile methodologies.

This week is technology agnostic - we don't mind what tech stack you use, although it would probably be easier on you to use a language or framework that you have learned here!

Here are some resources to help you to structure your week:

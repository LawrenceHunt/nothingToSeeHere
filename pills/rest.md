# REST

In the bad old days of building URLs there was no way of structuring them
properly. It was pretty common for a simple set of URLs for doing basic actions
like create, read, update and delete (CRUD) on something like adding a
restaurant to a database to look as messy as this:

* new_restaurant
* update_restaurant/123
* deleteRestaurant/123
* get_restaurant?id=123

Here we have nothing standardised, it's hard to understand what's going on and
hard to structure our app so that all of these routes point to the same
controller in our framework.

## Roy Fielding to the rescue!

When Roy Fielding published his doctorate on Representational State Transfer
(REST), he probably didn't realise it would end up transforming the entire
structure of the web.

In REST, URLs aren't just vague strings we make up on the spot. Instead they map
onto a *resource*. The idea of a *resource* is pretty much the same idea as an
object in OOP, it's just a **noun** that matches to something in the real world. So in the previous example, our resource would be `restaurants`, since this is what we're
creating/reading/updating/deleting.

The second idea of REST is that we can use a set of actions that HTTP allow us
to specify when we create a request. In HTTP, when you visit http://google.com
in your browser, behind the scenes Google Chrome actually sends a `GET` request
to the server and waits for a response.

request](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/head-first-servlets/9780596516680/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1377903.png.jpg)

But HTTP also allows us to use other verbs like `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`
when sending requests. Fielding realised that these verbs matched perfectly
onto CRUD. Using this knowledge, he showed how we could tidy up our URLs by
rather than having a different url/resource for each action, having one resource
for everything we want do:

* CREATE - POST /restaurants
* READ - GET /restaurants/123
* UPDATE - PATCH /restaurants/123
* DELETE - DELETE /restaurants/123

See how much tidier that is? Now we have one URL (although of course when
creating we don't have the ID as we don't know what it is until we've created it) rather than the mess of URLS we had previously.

Although there's of course much more to REST, understanding that it's all about
*resources*/*nouns* (like restaurants in this example), and *verbs*
(POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE) is the main thing you need to understand.

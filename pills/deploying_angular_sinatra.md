# Deploying your Sinatra / Angular application to Heroku

Deploying an Angular app that is hosted on a Sinatra backend can be somewhat frustrating. The reason being that Heroku will either assume that you are deploying a Node application and therefore ignore your sinatra server, or it will install a ruby app but fail to run NPM - therefore ignoring all your npm and bower components.

To get around this, follow these steps:

1. Move your bower_components directory to public/bower_components
2. Create a .bowerrc file in the top level of your application, and add the following text to it:
  ```
  {
    "directory": "public/bower_components"
  }
  ```
3. Add a buildpack to your Heroku env variables like so: ``` heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=git://github.com/qnyp/heroku-buildpack-ruby-bower.git#run-bower ```
4. Push to heroku
5. Profit!

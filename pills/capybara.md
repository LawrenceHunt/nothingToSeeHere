# Capybara

**What is Capybara?**

Capybara is a ruby gem that allows you to easily test the user experience of a web-based application. It provides methods that can mimic the actions a user would make in the browser, and test the outcomes of those actions in terms of what the user should be able to see. These methods can be used in conjunction with RSpec or Cucumber (or other test frameworks such as MiniTest, which are not covered in this course).

**How do I use capybara?**

Firstly, install capybara for your chosen feature test framework (usually RSpec or Cucumber), following the instructions in the [documentation](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara). This then allows the capybara methods to be used from within your tests.

RSpec

```
feature 'Home Page' do
  scenario 'view the welcome message' do
    visit '/'
    expect(page).to have_content('Welcome!')
  end
end
```

Cucumber (within homepage_steps.rb)
```
When /^(?:|I )go to (.+)$/ do |page_name|
  visit path_to(page_name)
end

When /^(?:|I )press "([^\"]*)"(?: within "([^\"]*)")?$/ do |button, selector|
  with_scope(selector) do
    click_button(button)
  end
end
```

**What methods are provided?**

Capybara methods can be broadly broken down into categories as follows:

1. Navigation - methods that navigate to a page, i.e. `visit '/'`
2. Clicking - methods that click something on a page, i.e. `click_button 'Submit'`
3. Interacting - methods that mimic the user entering form data, i.e. `fill_in('name', with: 'dave')`
4. Matching - methods that test expectations, i.e. `expect('#blog-post').to have_content('News')`
5. Scoping - methods that target a specific area of the page, i.e. `within('#blog-post') do`
6. Other - Other user actions such as checking check boxes, selecting select options or attaching files.

An excellent list of the primary capybara methods can be found in this [cheat sheet](http://www.cheatography.com/ddovii/cheat-sheets/capybara-cheat-sheet/).

## Playing with Capybara

To get a sense of how any tool works, it helps to be able to play with it from within your REPL. Let's get started.

For this you'll need to create a Gemfile and list two dependencies:

```ruby
# ./Gemfile

gem 'capybara'
gem 'selenium-webdriver'
```

We'll get into what these are in a second. Now crack open your favourite REPL (usually IRB or pry) and do the following:

```pry
[1] pry(main)> require 'capybara'
=> true
[2] pry(main)> require 'selenium-webdriver'
=> true
[3] pry(main)> include Capybara::DSL
including Capybara::DSL in the global scope is not recommended!
=> Object

```
What we've just done there is made Capybara's DSL directly available to us within our REPL, rather than just within the context of RSpec as we would want for a real test. Capybara throws up a warning but it's okay, we're just messing around here. Let's keep going.

```pry
[4] pry(main)> Capybara.default_driver = :selenium
=> :selenium
```
Capybara is just a DSL that allows you to *send instructions* to an automated browser, but it doesn't do any of the work that browsers have to do to send / receive via HTTP and render HTML. So here we've told Capybara to interface with a technology called [selenium webdriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) to carry out the "browser" part of our automated browser tests. We're choosing selenium because we'll get to see what's happening.

Now you can start exploring how Capybara works:

```pry
visit 'http://www.bbc.co.uk'
```

You should see a Firefox browser window pop up and a website load. Now play around with the Capybara commands and see what's possible. Things to try:
* Type `page`. Try `page.methods`. Try out some of the methods on the page object.
* Instruct the browser to click on a link or a button.
* Fill in a form.

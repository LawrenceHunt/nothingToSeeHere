# Rails helper methods

## What are helpers?

Rails has lots of helper methods which make life easier. These are methods which can be called on in your web app. `truncate`, for example, accepts a word and an integer as arguments, and then truncates that word if it's longer than the specified length. `pluralize` takes a singular noun and pluralizes it.

`rails console` is a nice way of trying them out interactively. For example, you could have a go with `truncate`:

```shell
> helper.truncate("Testing", length: 5)
=> "Te..."
```

Or how about `pluralize`?

```shell
> helper.pluralize(2, 'dog')
=> "2 dogs"
```

## Writing your own helpers

Rails has blank helper files set up for you.

Say you have a controller called `Restaurants`. Rails has already created a file for you – `app/helpers/restaurants_helper.rb` – with a module that gets automatically included by the app.

```ruby
module RestaurantsHelper
end
```

You write methods in that module and call them elsewhere. In the [Yelp walkthrough](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/rails/yelp_further_challenges/1_average_ratings.md#diy-helper-methods), there's an example of using a helper method to generate star ratings from a number. You can simply call that helper method in the view.

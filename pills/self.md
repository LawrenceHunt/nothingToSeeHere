# Understanding **self**, the current/default object

One of the cornerstones of Ruby programming—the backbone, in some respects—is the default object or current object, accessible to you in your program through the keyword _self_. 

At every point when your program is running, there is **one and only one** self.

## Who gets to be self, and where

There is always one (and only one) current object or self. You can tell which object it is by following a small set of rules. These rules are summarised in table 1.1.

To know which object is self, you need to know what context you’re in.

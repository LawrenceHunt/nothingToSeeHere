# Final Project Presentations

Here are some guidelines to help you get started when planning your final project presentations:

* The time limit is 5 minutes - practice, practice, practice to ensure you are around the correct length.
* Ensure that you clearly define the problem you are solving.
* Focus on the user story - if the audience empathises with the user, they will be able to see themselves using your app.
* If appropriate, make it funny. If not, make it engaging.
* Consider using a video for the technical demonstration, instead of using the live site.
* If you had a real client, describe the learning you gained from working with them.
* It's good to mention your code coverage - if you have coveralls or code climate on your app, feel free to boast about your score!
* It's OK to talk about the technology you used, although bear in mind that the audience probably do not have great technical knowledge, so it may go over their heads - keep it short and simple.

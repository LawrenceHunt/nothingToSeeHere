# true and false: boolean values

Apart from nil, there are other special objects built into into Ruby. One of them is **true** that means that a statement is valid (_true_) and the other one is **false**, indicating the opposite.

````ruby
2 + 2 == 4 #=> true
2 + 2 == 5 #=> false
2.even? #=> true
6.odd? #=> false
````

True and false are also called [boolean values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type). So, if you read that a method returns a boolean, this means that it will return either true or false.

Try it for yourself in irb. Double equals in the example above means comparison, instead of assignment (single equals).

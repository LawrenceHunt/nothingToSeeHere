## Sinatra 3: reloading code

If we wanted to have another page at `http://localhost:4567/secret`, then we'd do the following:

````ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  'hello!'
end

get '/secret' do
  'This is a secret page'
end
````
But wait! Having done this in your Sinatra application, visiting `http://localhost:4567/secret` in a browser gives you this page:

![alt text](images/sinatra/sinatra_basic_2.png)

An error! Another good time to commit your code, push it to Github (:pill: [Version Control with Git](git.md)), and switch Driver/Navigator Roles&nbsp;:twisted_rightwards_arrows:

### Reload your code

What's happening here? Nothing bad: Sinatra is telling you that it doesn't know what '/secret' is all about, despite you having written this in your app.

The problem: we haven't rebooted the server after making our changes. The running server has a `/` route, but no `/secret` one.

To stop the server, head to the terminal tab in which the server is running and hit `Ctrl-C`. Then restart the server just like you started it in the first place:

`$ ruby hello.rb`

Head back to _http://localhost:4567/secret_: it now works! But restarting the server manually every time we change the code is going to get very painful.

## Automatic code reloading

What we've been doing is restarting our server every time we made a change to the files because Sinatra needed to reload them. There's a way to reload the files without restarting the entire process.

Firstly, install a gem called **Shotgun** within this project. You already know how to require and install gems.

Secondly, load your application like this:

`$ shotgun hello.rb -p 4567`

The `-p` switch tells shotgun what port to use. Use this switch to keep the port consistent with the default Sinatra port. By default shotgun will use port 9393.

If you see a "Boot Error" when you're starting the application using shotgun, double check that you have required the _sinatra_ gem in the `Gemfile`, and have run `bundle install` afterwards.

> What does `bundle install` do? Are there any other uses for `bundle`?

Assuming that you get Shotgun working you can now make changes to your `hello.rb` file and see the changes with a simple browser refresh.  Try adjusting the strings in the `do ... end` blocks and reload the browser.

Next up, let's add some [HTML](html.md) to the mix.

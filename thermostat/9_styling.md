[Back to the Challenge Map](0_challenge_map.md)

While fully functional, it's rare to see a thermostat (or any app, really) in this sad state:

Instead, what we really want is something exploding with awesome, maybe even looking a bit like a Reservoir Dogs poster:

Or, influenced by whatever else you take your visual inspiration from.

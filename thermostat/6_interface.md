# Thermostat: interface

[Back to the Challenge Map](0_challenge_map.md)

You now have some well tested business logic, representing simple model of a thermostat. However, at the moment, the only way you can interact with the code is either through the console or tests. It's time to build a user interface.

In this challenge, you will build the skeleton of a UI, so that you can then start interacting with your underlying logic.

### Learning Objectives covered

- Use Jasmine to Test-Drive Development of a web page with advanced JavaScript functionality

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:
- [ ] Decide what elements you will need as input and output for your thermostat
- [ ] Build a static HTML page with these elements, labelling them with appropriate classes and/or IDs
- [ ] Add your thermostat JavaScript to the page
